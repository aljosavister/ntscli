# Coding Standards Summary

This document outlines the coding standards for the project based on the configuration file. The configuration file defines rules for linting and code style.

## Default Severity

- The default severity level for linting issues is set to **"error"**, indicating that any rule violations should be treated as errors rather than warnings.

## Rule Extensions

- The coding standards extend the configuration from **"tslint:recommended"**, which includes recommended coding standards and rules for TypeScript projects.

## Custom TSLint Rules

### `no-console`

- Allow the use of `console` statements in the code.

### `object-literal-sort-keys`

- Do not enforce sorting of keys in object literals. Object keys can be in any order.

### `object-literal-key-quotes`

- Enforce the use of quotes around object literal keys when they are needed. For example, if a key contains spaces or special characters, quotes must be used. Otherwise, quotes are optional.

### `trailing-comma`

- Do not enforce the use of trailing commas in lists or object literals. Trailing commas can be omitted.

## Prettier Rules

- Prettier is configured with the following rules:
  - `arrowParens`: Always include parentheses around arrow function parameters.
  - `singleQuote`: Do not use single quotes for string literals; use double quotes instead.

## Rules Directory

- There are no custom rule directories specified in this configuration.

These coding standards provide flexibility in coding style while still adhering to best practices recommended by the `"tslint:recommended"` configuration and Prettier rules.
